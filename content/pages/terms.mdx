**Welcome to Chatbase!**

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Chatbase browser extension and any related websites or services (collectively, the "Service"). By installing, accessing, or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

### 1. Description of Chatbase

Chatbase is a browser-based tool that helps you extract structured data (such as tables, lists, and similar content) from AI chat assistants and send that data to external tools like Airtable, Google Sheets, Notion, and other supported integrations. The Service is provided for your own use and automation convenience only.

### 2. Third-Party Services

Chatbase connects to and interacts with third-party services and platforms (for example, Airtable, Google, Notion, and others). Your use of any third-party service through Chatbase is also subject to that third party's terms and policies. You are solely responsible for:

- Complying with the applicable terms of any third-party services you connect to.  
- Maintaining any required accounts, subscriptions, or permissions with those services.  

Chatbase is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or responsible for any third-party services.

### 3. User Accounts and Licenses

If the Service requires a license, subscription, or activation key:

- You must provide accurate and up-to-date information when purchasing or activating a license.  
- Licenses are personal to you and may be limited to a specific number of browsers or devices as described on the pricing or product page.  
- You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any keys, tokens, or access credentials associated with your use of the Service.

Chatbase may suspend or terminate access if fraudulent use, abuse, or violation of these Terms is detected.

### 4. Data Handling and Privacy

Chatbase operates primarily as a client-side browser extension that processes content displayed in your browser.

- The extension may read and process content from AI chat pages and other supported sites in order to extract structured data and send it to your chosen integrations.  
- Chatbase does not claim ownership over the content you process through the extension. You remain responsible for ensuring you have the right to use and transfer such content.  
- Any personal data collected (for example, email, license details, or integration tokens) is used only to provide and maintain the Service, in accordance with the Privacy Policy linked from the product website.  

You must not use the Service to process content that you are not legally allowed to access, copy, or transmit.

### 5. Acceptable Use

You agree not to:

- Use the Service for any illegal, harmful, or unauthorized purpose.  
- Attempt to bypass technical limitations, license restrictions, or security features.  
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or modify the extension except where permitted by applicable law.  
- Automate or scrape third-party services in violation of their terms, rate limits, or policies.  

You are solely responsible for any use of the Service and any consequences arising from how you extract and send data.

### 6. Payments, Subscriptions, and Refunds

If you purchase a paid plan (monthly, yearly, or lifetime):

- Pricing, plan limits, and browser/device allowances are described on the product website or in the extension.  
- Subscriptions will typically renew automatically at the end of each billing period unless you cancel before renewal through the payment provider or account management page.  
- Lifetime plans are one-time purchases that grant access as described at the time of purchase, subject to these Terms and any reasonable technical or business limitations.

Refunds, if offered, will be handled according to the refund policy stated on the product or checkout page at the time of purchase. Where no specific refund policy is stated, refunds are not guaranteed and are at the discretion of Chatbase.

### 7. Intellectual Property

All rights, title, and interest in and to the Service (including the code, design, branding, and documentation) are owned by the Chatbase owner or licensors. Your use of the Service grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use the extension in accordance with these Terms.

You may not use the Chatbase name, logo, or branding without prior written permission, except for fair and accurate references.

### 8. Disclaimers

The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. Without limiting the foregoing, Chatbase does not warrant that:

- The Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure.  
- The Service will continue to support any particular third-party integration or platform.  
- The data extracted or transferred will be accurate, complete, or preserved without loss.

You use the Service at your own risk. You are responsible for verifying any important data and maintaining your own backups.

### 9. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Chatbase and its owner(s), developers, and affiliates will not be liable for:

- Any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages.  
- Any loss of data, profits, revenue, or business opportunities.  

In any case, the total liability arising out of or in connection with the Service will be limited to the amount you paid for the Service in the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or, if no payment was made, to a reasonable amount determined by applicable law.

### 10. Changes to the Service and Terms

The Service may be updated, modified, or discontinued at any time, including adding or removing features or integrations.

These Terms may also be updated from time to time. When changes are made, the "Last Updated" date will be revised. Continued use of the Service after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.

### 11. Termination

You may stop using the Service and uninstall the extension at any time. Chatbase may suspend or terminate your access if:

- You violate these Terms or applicable laws.  
- There is suspected fraud, abuse, or security risk.  
- The Service is discontinued.

Sections of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination (such as intellectual property, disclaimers, and limitations of liability) will continue to apply.

### 12. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of India, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising under or in connection with the Service will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in India, unless applicable law requires otherwise.
