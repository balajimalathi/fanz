## **🙏🏻wanakkam, it's balaji**

As a developer, I always found it frustrating how many times I missed on **sharing updates** about my work. Every time I pushed a major update or merged an important PR, I had to:

- **Manually write release notes**
- **Draft social media posts** for Twitter, LinkedIn, and blogs
- **Keep my audience engaged** without spending hours on content creation

It wasn't just my struggle. I saw **open-source maintainers, indie developers, and even teams** facing the same issue. Developers love building, but **sharing their progress felt like an afterthought**.

One day, after spending an hour crafting a simple LinkedIn post about my latest feature update, I thought 👉 **why can't this be automated?** If GitHub already tracks my code changes, why can't it help me share my work too?

That's how **RepoVox** is created. 🚀

I wanted a tool that:  
✅ **Listens to my GitHub activity** (commits, PRs, releases)  
✅ **Generates AI-powered content** (tweets, slack messages, mail updates)  
✅ **Automates publishing** so I don't have to manually share everything

With RepoVox, developers can **focus on coding** while it **handles the storytelling**. Now, every commit has a voice, every PR tells a story, and every developer gets the visibility they deserve, without extra effort.

💡 **If you're a developer who hates writing updates but loves shipping code, RepoVox is for you.**

Let's make sharing effortless. 🔥
