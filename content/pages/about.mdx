# About Us

## Built by an Indie Hacker for Fellow Makers

Chatbase was created by a solo founder and full-stack developer from India who's just like you - building multiple SaaS products while juggling limited time, budget, and resources.

## The Problem That Started It All

Every day, I was generating **content calendars, task lists, lead research, and competitor tables** in ChatGPT... then spending **2-3 hours manually copy-pasting** them into Airtable, Google Sheets, and Notion.

**The pains were real:**
- Formatting always broke
- Data got lost in transcription  
- Zapier felt like overkill for a simple "move this table there" job
- I just wanted **one-click structured data export**

## Born from Real Need

So I built Chatbase in **one weekend** - a lightweight browser extension that:
- **Auto-detects** tables and lists from any AI chat
- **Visually maps** AI columns to your tools
- **One-click pushes** to Airtable, Sheets, Notion, and more
- **Zero servers, zero complexity** - runs entirely in your browser

## Why Chatbase is Different

```
❌ Others: Heavy automation platforms (Zapier, Make)
✅ Chatbase: Simple browser extension (10 seconds)

❌ Others: Complex setup, API keys everywhere  
✅ Chatbase: Install → Connect → Done

❌ Others: Expensive ($20+/month minimum)
✅ Chatbase: $2.99/month starter (unlimited exports)
```

## My Philosophy

**"Solve my own problem first, then help 10,000 others solve theirs."**

- **No VC funding** - Bootstrapped, profitable from day 1
- **No team** - Solo-built with React, Tailwind, and your feedback
- **No bloat** - Only the features that actually save time

## What's Next

Your feedback shapes Chatbase. I'm adding:
- More integrations (Monday.com, Asana, HubSpot CRM)
- Template sharing community
- Mobile app (Flutter)

## Join the Journey

Chatbase isn't just a product - it's **proof that solo founders can build $10K/month tools in weekends**.

**Have a feature request? Email me directly. Let's build this together.**
