## Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-10  

This Privacy Policy explains how Chatbase (“Chatbase”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use our browser extension and any related websites or services (collectively, the “Service”).

By installing, accessing, or using the Service, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

***

## 1. What Chatbase Does

Chatbase is a browser extension that helps you extract structured data (such as tables and lists) from AI chat assistants and send that data to external tools like Airtable, Google Sheets, Notion, and other supported integrations. The extension primarily operates within your browser.

***

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Information You Provide

Depending on how you use the Service, we may collect:

- **Account / Contact Information**  
  - Email address (for licensing, support, and communication).  
  - Name or display name (optional, if you choose to provide it).  

- **Payment Information**  
  - Payment processing is handled by third-party providers (such as Dodo Payments or similar platforms).  
  - We do **not** store your full payment card details. We may receive limited billing-related information (e.g., transaction ID, last 4 digits) from the payment provider for record-keeping and support.

### 2.2 Extension Data (Local Processing)

The extension may:

- Read and process content on pages you explicitly interact with (e.g., AI chat windows) to detect tables, lists, and structured data.  
- Store certain configuration data locally in your browser, such as:
  - Integration settings (e.g., which Airtable base or sheet to send data to).  
  - Field mapping templates.  
  - License or activation status.

This data is generally stored using your browser's local storage or sync mechanisms and is not automatically transmitted to our servers unless explicitly required for licensing or error reporting.

### 2.3 Integration Tokens

When you connect third-party tools (e.g., Airtable, Google Sheets, Notion):

- The Service may use API tokens or OAuth access tokens to send data from your browser directly to those tools.  
- Where possible, tokens are stored securely in your browser and used only for the purpose of enabling the integration you requested.  
- We do not use these tokens to access your data for any other purpose.

***

## 3. What We Do **Not** Collect Intentionally

- We do not intentionally collect or store the **full content of your AI conversations**.  
- We do not use your AI chat content to train any models or for advertising.  
- We do not sell your personal data.

However, you are responsible for ensuring that you only use the Service with content you are allowed to handle and share under applicable laws and the terms of the platforms you use.

***

## 4. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- Provide, operate, and maintain the Service.  
- Verify and manage licenses and subscriptions.  
- Enable and manage integrations with third-party tools.  
- Communicate with you about updates, support, and important service-related notices.  
- Improve the Service, fix bugs, and enhance the user experience.  
- Comply with legal obligations.

***

## 5. Cookies and Analytics (Website Only)

If we operate a website or dashboard:

- We may use **cookies** or similar technologies to remember your preferences and improve your experience.  
- We may use basic analytics tools to understand aggregate usage (e.g., page views, referrers, device types).  
- Analytics will be configured, where possible, to avoid collecting unnecessary personally identifiable information.

The browser extension itself is not designed to track your browsing history beyond what is necessary to function on supported pages.

***

## 6. Sharing of Information

We may share limited information in the following situations:

- **Payment Processors**  
  With third-party payment providers to process your payments and manage subscriptions.

- **Service Providers**  
  With trusted service providers who help us operate the Service (e.g., hosting, email services), under appropriate confidentiality and data protection obligations.

- **Legal Requirements**  
  If required by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request.

We do not sell your personal data to third parties.

***

## 7. Third-Party Services and APIs

When you connect Chatbase to external services (e.g., Airtable, Google, Notion):

- Your use of those services is governed by their own terms and privacy policies.  
- Data sent to those services (such as extracted tables) is controlled by you and handled under those services' policies.  
- We are not responsible for how third-party platforms handle your data once it has been sent from the extension.

You should review the privacy policies of any third-party tools you choose to integrate.

***

## 8. Data Security

We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the information we control, including:

- Using secure communication (HTTPS) where applicable.  
- Storing sensitive tokens in browser storage with appropriate safeguards where possible.  
- Limiting server-side storage of personal data to what is necessary for licensing, billing, and support.

However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure. You use the Service at your own risk and should maintain your own security practices (strong passwords, device protection, etc.).

***

## 9. Data Retention

We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to:

- Provide and maintain the Service.  
- Fulfill legal, accounting, or reporting obligations.  
- Resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.

You may request deletion or correction of your personal information, subject to any legal obligations that may require us to retain certain data.

***

## 10. Children's Privacy

The Service is not intended for children under the age of 16 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.

***

## 11. Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data, such as:

- Accessing the personal data we hold about you.  
- Requesting correction or deletion of your data.  
- Objecting to or restricting certain processing.  
- Porting your data to another service where technically feasible.

To exercise these rights, please contact us using the details provided below. We may need to verify your identity before responding.

***

## 12. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last Updated” date at the top of this page. Significant changes may also be communicated via email or through notices in the Service.

Your continued use of the Service after any updates means you accept the revised Privacy Policy.
