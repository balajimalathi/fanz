# Google Sheets Integration

Connect CreatorX to your Google account to export chat data directly into your spreadsheets.

## Connection Steps

<Steps>

### Sign in with Google

1. Open the CreatorX extension popup.
2. Navigate to the **Integrations** tab.
3. Click on the **Google Sheets** option.
4. Click the **Sign in with Google** button.
5. A popup window will appear requesting permission to access your spreadsheets.

### Grant Permissions

Ensure you grant the necessary permissions for CreatorX to:
- See and list all your Google Drive files (to list spreadsheets).
- See, and edit all your Google Sheets spreadsheets (to write data).

### Select Data Destination

Once authenticated:
1. You will see a list of your available spreadsheets.
2. Select the **Spreadsheet** you want to use.
3. Select the specific **Worksheet** (tab) within that file.
4. (Optional) Toggle "First row is header" if your sheet has headers.

</Steps>

## Features

- **Row Appending**: New chat exports will be appended as new rows in your sheet.
- **Smart Mapping**: Automatically map chat fields (User, Message, Date) to your sheet columns.
- **Instant Sync**: Data appears in your Google Sheet immediately after export.

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Error**: If the sign-in popup closes immediately or fails, try disabling other extensions that might interfere with popups, or check your browser's third-party cookie settings.
- **Permission Denied**: If you can't write to a sheet, ensure you have "Editor" access to that specific spreadsheet in Google Drive.

<Callout>

**Privacy Notice:** CreatorX complies with Google's API Services User Data Policy. We only access the spreadsheets you explicitly select for export.
