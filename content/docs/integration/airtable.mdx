# Airtable Integration

Connect CreatorX provided by your Airtable account to seamlessly export your chat conversations and data directly into your bases.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
1. An active [Airtable account](https://airtable.com).
2. The CreatorX extension installed on your browser.

## Connection Steps

<Steps>

### Get your Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. Go to your [Airtable Builder Hub](https://airtable.com/create/tokens).
2. Click on **Create new token**.
3. Give your token a name (e.g., "CreatorX").
4. Under **Scopes**, add the following permissions:
   - `data.records:read`
   - `data.records:write`
   - `schema.bases:read`
5. Under **Access**, select the bases you want to connect (or choose "All current and future bases" for easier management).
6. Click **Create token** and copy the generated token string.

### Configure CreatorX

1. Open the CreatorX extension popup.
2. Navigate to the **Integrations** tab.
3. Select **Airtable**.
4. Paste your **Personal Access Token** into the input field.
5. Click **Connect**.

### Verify Connection

Once connected, you should see a success message. You can now:
- Browse your Bases and Tables directly from the extension.
- Configure field mappings for your exports.

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

- **Invalid Token**: Ensure you copied the entire token string and that the token hasn't expired or been revoked.
- **Missing Permissions**: If you can't see your bases or write data, verify that the token has `data.records:write` and `schema.bases:read` scopes.
- **Base Access**: If a specific base isn't showing up, check if the token was granted access to that specific base.

**Note:** We prioritize your security. Your Personal Access Token is stored locally on your device and is never sent to our servers except to communicate directly with Airtable's API.
